# Welcome to Bridgetown!

# This config file is for settings that affect your whole site, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that.

# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# `bin/bridgetown start`. If you change this file, please restart the server process.
#
# For reloadable site metadata like title, SEO description, social media
# handles, etc., take a look at `src/_data/site_metadata.yml`
