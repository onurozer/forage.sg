Eggs poached in spicy tomato sauce with herbs and peppers? Shut up and take my money! This is the quintessential mediterranean brunch dish, although it works perfectly for dinner and supper too.

This recipe is a very flexible, customize it to your heart’s content: There’s no meat below, but adding chorizo or bacon is highly encouraged. The yogurt helps balance out the spice, but feta cheese does wonders too.

Don’t forget to serve it with crusty, toasted [sourdough bread](__GHOST_URL__/sourdough-bread-guide/), otherwise the shakshuka police will hunt you down and make you pay!

This recipe below is for 2 normal people and takes about 30 minutes.

### Ingredients

- 4 eggs
- 3 tbsp of extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 yellow onion, halved and sliced

- 1 tbsp greek yogurt

### Instructions

3. Add tomatoes and break down using the back of a wooden spoon
4. Let it simmer on low-medium heat until tomato sauce starts to thicken, about 10 minutes
5. Gently crack eggs, use the spoon to dig a nest for the eggs in the sauce

7. Add greek yogurt in the middle and chopped herbs on top, season with salt, pepper and cayenne

## Tips & Tricks

- Cast iron skillet is fantastic for this but make sure it’s well seasoned, almost non-stick. Otherwise the acid in tomato will ruin your pan and you’ll cry.
- Most recipes call for baking the eggs, which makes you look cool but completely unnecessary.
- You know your eggs are ready to add when the tomato sauce has reduced but not completely dry.
- Canned tomatoes work better than fresh tomatoes, unless you grow your own tomatoes in your idyllic backyard, in which case feel free to use them.
