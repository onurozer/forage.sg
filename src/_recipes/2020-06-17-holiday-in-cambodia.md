This tropical cocktail was invented in Singapore a few years ago by a master bartender -me- and my cocktail workshop partner [Riku](https://www.instagram.com/rvassinen/). It was named after the fact that his wife was on a getaway in Cambodia while we were toiling away in the kitchen to bring home the dough, in this case the dough being tomahawk steaks and cocktails.

The original recipe used [Paper Lantern Gin](https://drinkpaperlantern.com), the self-proclaimed Singapore’s first craft gin, ironically made with ingredients from Vietnam and coincidentally by a Turkish founder.  That said, any craft peppery gin will work equally well, or maybe even better.

This recipe requires lemongrass syrup, a key ingredient that gives the cocktail it’s intoxicating flavour and aroma.

## Ingredients

### For the lemongrass syrup:

- 100g white sugar
- 100g water
- 3-4 lemongrass stalks, bruised and sliced

### For the cocktail:

- 60ml gin
- 30ml lemon juice, freshly squeezed
- 20ml lemongrass syrup
- 1 egg white
- [Angostura bitters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angostura_bitters) to garnish

## Instructions

### For the lemongrass syrup:

1. Stir ingredients in a saucepan over medium heat until it starts to simmer,
2. Turn off the heat and steep for 10 minutes.
3. Strain through a cheesecloth or a fine mesh strainer into a bottle, keep in the fridge for up to a month

### For the cocktail:

1. Pour the gin, lemon juice, lemongrass syrup and egg white into a shaker without ice and shake vigorously
2. Add ice cubes and shake again until ice cold, about 30 seconds
3. Strain through a tea strainer into a chilled coupe
4. Garnish with a few drops of angostura bitters.

## Tips & Tricks

- Use the freshest eggs you can find, unless you enjoy mild food poisoning.
- Shaking all the ingredients without ice is called a “dry shake” and helps get rid of the egg-y smell. Angostura bitters also serves the same purpose.
- The harder you shake, the smoother your foam will become.
- Strange trivia: angostura bitters had [super sexist weird ads](https://punchdrink.com/articles/seriously-whats-up-with-angostura-bitters-vintage-midcentury-ads/) in the 50’s.
