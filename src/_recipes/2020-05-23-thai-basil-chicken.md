The punchy aromas of this quintessential street food beckons at every other corner as you walk through the busy and gritty streets of Bangkok. This dish is a go-to comfort food that can be cooked up in a flash with a fire-in-the-belly sensation that lingers.

Recipe below for 2 people. About 15 minutes total including preparation.

## Ingredients

- 200g chicken, minced
- 5 cloves of garlic, chopped
- 2 birds eye chilies, chopped (use Serrano chillies for less heat)
- 1 handful of Thai basil leaves
- 1 tbsp oyster sauce
- 1 tsp dark soy sauce
- 1 tsp fishsauce
- 1 tsp palm sugar
- 1 tbsp oil
- 1 tbsp water
- 1 egg

## Instructions

1. Crack an egg into the centre of a hot non-stick frying pan with 2 tbsp of oil and allow it to sizzle. Scoop some hot oil and splash it over the egg to help with the cooking. Once done, set the fried egg aside on a paper towel to absorb excess oil.
2. Heat up some oil in the pan and add the chopped garlic and chillies.
3. Stir-fry quickly for about 30 secs until they get fragrant. Be careful not to leave too long as garlic burns quickly.
4. Toss in the minced chicken and continue to stir fry. Add the water and cook the chicken all the way through, about 6-8 minutes.
5. Add the oyster sauce, dark sauce, fish sauce and the palm sugar and keep stir-frying for another 2 mins.
6. Once the sugars start to turn glossy in the pan, toss in the basil and cook for another 30 secs before turning off the heat.

To serve, spoon the chicken over a bed of steaming Jasmine rice and place the fried egg on top. Garnish with a sprig of basil leaves and enjoy.
