## Tips & Tricks

- You can use an entire chicken, which will be just as tasty but everything from resting to cooking will take slightly longer.
- Feel free to experiment with spices. Curry powder and crushed coriander seeds give a bit more asian flavour. Sichuan peppers and cayenne give it a nice little kick.
- Raclette potatoes work exceptionally well with this dish. Quarter them for a chunky bite or use a mandoline slicer for that homemade potato chip vibe.
- Leftover (if any) chicken makes a superb sandwich the next day. Serve in it a sandwich bread with Japanese mayo, sliced San Marzano tomatoes and a bit of lettuce. Heaven.
