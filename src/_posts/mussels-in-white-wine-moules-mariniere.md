Are you in the mood for seafood dinner, but donâ€™t feel like to putting in the effort? Mussels to the rescue. This recipe is also perfect when staying in an Airbnb, because it requires only the most basic tools and ingredients.

The star of this dish is the mussels, so make sure you get the freshest ones you can find. The [New Zealand Green Mussels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perna_canaliculus) are amazing with this recipe, but the common [Blue Mussels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_mussel) would work just fine too.

## Tips & Tricks

- The cheaper the wine, the better it is. If you have a mediocre bottle that your stingy friend brought over that has been sitting around for ages, now is the time to open it.
- This dish obviously goes down perfectly with dry white wine such as a Sauvignon Blanc, but a Belgian beer such as [Leffe](https://leffe.com/en/) would be great too.
- The sourdough is ideal for mopping up the sauces. Toasting in the oven with a bit of olive oil makes it even more decadent.
- Experiment with red chili, lemongrass, ginger or even curry leaves for an Asian twist.
