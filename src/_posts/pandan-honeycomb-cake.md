servings: 2-3
duration: 20 mins to prepare, 45 mins to bake
ingredients:
  - 100ml coconut milk
  - 100g sugar
  - 1 pinch salt
  - 1/4 tsp pandan extract
  - 3 eggs
  - 120g tapioca starch
  - 1 1/4 tsp baking powder
  - Vanilla extract

instructions:
  - Grease only the bottom of your baking pan and put it in the oven with temperature setting of 175C
  - In a small saucepan under low heat, dissolve the salt and sugar with coconut milk.
  - Crack the eggs in a mixing bowl and use a whisk to stir the eggs. Itâ€™s important that you do not beat or whisk the eggs. Simply stir the eggs with the tip of the whisk touching the bottom of the bowl. Avoid creating foam.
  - Add the coconut mixture to the egg mixture and give it a few stirs. Sift the starch and baking powder into the mixture and stir gently in one direction until smooth. Again, avoid creating foam. Add pandan juice/extract and vanilla.
  - Remove the baking pan from the oven and strain the batter directly into the hot baking pan.
  - Place the baking pan right in the middle of the over and bake at 175C for 45min or until the top is golden brown. Insert a skewer into the center of the cake to test for doneness. If the toothpick comes out clean, the cake is done.
  - Cool the cake in its pan, upside down on a cooling rack. When cooled, use a palette knife to loosen and release the cake from the sides.

This uniquely chewy and popular Vietnamese cake gets its name from the distinct honeycomb-like structure in its cross-section. The honeycomb is a result of expanding hot air tunnelling through the tapioca batter, yielding a texture that is fluffy and bouncy.

You can make this cake with a number of flavours, but Pandan is the most common and by far the best complement to the coconut milk. When baked, Pandan fills the house with such a wonderful aroma that builds up the anticipation of a delicious afternoon snack.
