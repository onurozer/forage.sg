Australians have a knack when it comes to spiking otherwise innocent beverages with booze, and they have some of the best coffee in the world. It’s therefore no surprise that they make killer Espresso Martinis, a boozy coffee or a sobering cocktail depending on your perspective.

The choice of coffee liqueur plays an important part in this recipe, and again Australians rule in the coffee liqueur department. I highly recommend [Mr. Black](https://mrblack.co/row/products/coffee-liqueur/) from Sydney, a cold brew coffee liqueur that makes excellent espresso martinis. [Carter’s Coffee Liqueur](https://www.applewooddistillery.com.au/collections/current-collection/products/carters-original-coffee-liqueur) from Applewood Distillery in Adelaide is another great example, and a bit sweeter. Of course, you can always use Kahlúa in an emergency, but remember that I will judge you.

## Tips & Tricks

- Swap your coffee on a Sunday brunch with this Espresso martini for a much more enjoyable brunch.
- Add a splash of sugar syrup before shaking if you like your cocktails sweet.
- Feeling experimental? Try the [St. George Green Chile Vodka](http://www.stgeorgespirits.com/spirits/vodka/st-george-green-chile-vodka/) in this recipe for a plot twist.
