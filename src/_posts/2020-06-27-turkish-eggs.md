This dish is called “Çılbır” (pronounced chill-brr) in Turkey. According to Wikipedia, is has been a big hit among Ottoman sultans since the 15th century. It represent some of the recurring themes in Turkish cuisine, such as garlic yoghurt, chili butter and parsley.

Surprisingly, the most popular egg dish in Turkey is actually [Menemen](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menemen_(food)>), so I’m not exactly sure how Çılbır got the spotlight and ended up being called the “Turkish eggs” instead. I blame the food bloggers.

The recipe calls for “Pul Biber” (Aleppo pepper flakes) which are hugely popular in Turkey, but the average chili flakes will also do fine. It is for 2 people and takes about 15 mins.

## Ingredients

- 300g yogurt, preferably Turkish (obviously)
- 4 eggs
- 2 cloves of garlic, minched
- 75g butter
- 2tsp aleppo or chili pepper flakes
- A few sprigs of dill or parsley, finely chopped
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Mix yogurt with garlic and a pinch of salt and stir with a fork. You can also warm the yogurt slightly over low heat using the [Bain-marie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bain-marie) method.
2. Poach eggs and set aside
3. Heat butter in a saucepan with peppers and stir until butter is melted.
4. Assemble into two plates starting with warm garlic yogurt, poached eggs and chili butter.
5. Garnish with chopped herbs, salt, pepper and serve with toasted [sourdough bread](__GHOST_URL__/sourdough-bread-guide/).

Once served, it goes from warm to cold fairly quickly so dig in right away!
