This dish is called “Çılbır” (pronounced chill-brr) in Turkey. According to Wikipedia, is has been a big hit among Ottoman sultans since the 15th century. It represent some of the recurring themes in Turkish cuisine, such as garlic yoghurt, chili butter and parsley.

Surprisingly, the most popular egg dish in Turkey is actually [Menemen](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menemen_(food)>), so I’m not exactly sure how Çılbır got the spotlight and ended up being called the “Turkish eggs” instead. I blame the food bloggers.

The recipe calls for “Pul Biber” (Aleppo pepper flakes) which are hugely popular in Turkey, but the average chili flakes will also do fine.

This recipe goes perfectly with toasted [sourdough bread](__GHOST_URL__/sourdough-bread-guide/).
