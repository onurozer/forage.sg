servings: 4
duration: 45 minutes
ingredients:
  - 160g all-purpose flour
  - 200g brown sugar
  - 3/4 tsp baking powder
  - 3/4 tsp baking soda
  - 1/4 tsp salt
  - 1 large egg
  - 2 large very ripe bananas, mashed
  - 120ml warm water
  - 60ml whole milk
  - 60ml canola oil or any other light oil
  - 3/4 tsp vanilla extract

instructions:
  - Preheat oven to 180°C and place rack in the centre of the oven
  - Brush the insides of a baking loaf tin with canola oil and set aside
  - In a large mixing bowl, dry whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt.
  - In another large mixing bowl, whisk the eggs, mashed bananas, water, milk, oil and vanilla extract – in no particular order.
  - Now add the wet ingredients to the bowl of dry ingredients and whisk until all combined. The batter is quite thin here, don’t worry.
  - Pour the batter into the oil-brushed loaf tin and bake for 40-45mins.
  - Insert a skewer or bamboo stick into the centre of the cake to check for doneness. If the stick comes out still with wet batter, continue baking for another 5-10mins.
  - If the skewer comes out clean, remove the loaf tin from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack.
  - Once cooled, release the banana cake from the tin.

Why is this sometimes called a cake and at other times called a bread? No one really knows but more importantly, the name is not important! All you need to know is that this baked oldie is a goodie that’s great as a breakfast, tea-time break or a post-meal indulgence.

The best part about this cake is its oh-so easy recipe with simply a whisk. The most difficult part? Waiting for those bananas to blacken for an even more aromatic bake!

You can enjoy the cake warm with a cup of coffee or keep it in the fridge for a couple of days.
