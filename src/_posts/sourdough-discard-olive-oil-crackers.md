## Tips & Tricks

- The beauty of these crackers is that you can make them in an infinite number of flavours. Experiment with oregano, dried onions, paprika…. the pantry is your oyster really.
- The secret to super thin and crispy crackers is a pasta roller. If you don’t have one, you can still use a rolling pin and good old muscle power.
- Roll the dough portions using your both hands into long and thin (1/2cm) cylinders to make breadsticks instead of crackers.
- Use a pizza or ravioli cutter to slice the dough into neat rectangles before baking, or crack with your hands for a more rustic shape after baking.
- The less adventurous your herb mixture, the better the resulting crackers go with a cheese-plate.
