Nothing makes fresh tomatoes sing like a bruschetta! Even better, for a symphonic Italian opera to your taste buds, just pair it with hand-shredded sweet basil leaves, punchy garlic and a sourdough slice hot out of the oven. Drizzle some extra virgin olive oil and a sprinkle of sea salt and youâ€™ll be hearing Pavarotti in your kitchen!

The recipe below takes 5 minutes and for 2 people.

## Ingredients

- 2 large slices of [sourdough bread](__GHOST_URL__/sourdough-bread-guide/)
- 20 cherry tomatoes, San Marzano tomatoes taste amazing if you can find it
- 2 cloves of garlic
- Handful of sweet basil leaves
- 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, preferably Italian
- Pinch of sea salt

## Instructions

1. Slice cherry tomatoes into quarters, first across and then lengthwise and put into a mixing bowl.
2. Pick the sweet basil leaves off the main stem and shred them by hand into mixing bowl
3. Mince 1 clove of garlic on a microplane or with a garlic press into mixing bowl
4. Add 1 tbsp of olive into the mixing bowl and give the ingredients a gentle toss for an even distribution of garlic.
5. Toast bread till golden brown and when still warm, gently rub a clove of garlic over the bread.
6. To assemble, spoon the tossed tomato-basil mix to on top of the bread.

Drizzle the bruschetta with the remaining olive oil, sprinkle a pinch of sea salt and enjoy!
