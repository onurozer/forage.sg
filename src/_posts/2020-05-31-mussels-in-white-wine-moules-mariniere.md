Are you in the mood for a decadent seafood dinner for a date or a Sunday night, but don’t feel like to putting in a lot of effort? Mussels to the rescue. This recipe is also perfect when staying in an Airbnb, because it can be put together with very basic tools and ingredients.

The star of this dish is the mussels, so make sure you get the freshest ones you can find. The [New Zealand Green Mussels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perna_canaliculus) are amazing with this recipe, but the common [Blue Mussels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_mussel) would work perfectly as well.

## Tips & Tricks

- The cheaper the wine, the better it is. If you have a bottle that your stingy friend brought over but it has been sitting around for ages, now is the time to open it.
- This dish obviously goes perfect with dry white wine such as a Sauvignon Blanc, but a Belgian beer such as [Leffe](https://leffe.com/en/) would be great too.
- The sourdough is perfect for mopping up the sauce, toasting in the oven with a bit of olive oil makes it even more decadent.
- Experiment with red chili, lemongrass, ginger or even curry leaves for Asian flavours.
