One of the biggest problems with maintaining a [sourdough starter](__GHOST_URL__/sourdough-starter-guide/) is what to do with all the discarded flour. This recipe solves this problem. These crackers also work perfectly with cheese plates, so much so that you may never buy crackers from a store again.

ingredients:

- 100g sourdough starter discard
- 66g all purpose flour
- 16g olive oil
- 3g dried rosemary
- 3g garlic powder
- A pinch of coarse salt

instructions:

- Mix starter, flour, olive oil and herbs

2. Knead for 4-6 minutes in a stand mixer or by hand, until the dough holds its shape
3. Wrap the dough in cling wrap and refrigerate anywhere from 30 minutes to 24hrs.
4. Preheat oven to 175c. Take out the dough and divide into four.
5. Roll each portion of dough into super thin sheets.
6. Transfer the dough sheets into a parchment lined baking tray. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt.
7. Bake in the oven at 175c for about 20 minutes or until it starts to brown.
8. Let the crackers cool completely on a wire rack before dividing into smaller pieces.

## Tips & Tricks

- The beauty of these crackers is that you can make them in an infinite number of flavours. Experiment with oregano, dried onions, paprika…. the pantry is your oyster really.
- The secret to super thin and crispy crackers is a pasta roller. If you don’t have one, you can still use a rolling pin and good old muscle power.
- Roll the dough portions using your both hands into long and thin (1/2cm) cylinders to make breadsticks instead of crackers.
- Use a pizza or ravioli cutter to slice the dough into neat rectangles before baking, or crack with your hands for a more rustic shape after baking.
- The less adventurous your herb mixture, the better the resulting crackers go with a cheese-plate.
