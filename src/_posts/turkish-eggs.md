This dish is called “Çılbır” (pronounced chill-brr) in Turkey. Apparently, is has been a [big hit among Ottoman sultans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Çılbır) since the 15th century. It features some of the recurring themes in Turkish cuisine, such as garlic yoghurt, chili butter and parsley.

The most popular egg dish in Turkey is actually [Menemen](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menemen_(food)>), so I’m not exactly sure how this dish stole the spotlight. I blame the food bloggers.

The recipe calls for "Pul Biber" (Aleppo pepper flakes) which are hugely popular in Turkey, but the average chili flakes will also work.
