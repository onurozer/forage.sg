This uniquely chewy and popular Vietnamese cake gets its name from the distinct honeycomb-like structure in its cross-section. The honeycomb is a result of expanding hot air tunnelling through the tapioca batter, yielding a texture that is fluffy and bouncy.

You can make this cake with a number of flavours, but Pandan is the most common and by far the best complement to the coconut milk. When baked, Pandan fills the house with such a wonderful aroma that builds up the anticipation of a delicious afternoon snack.

The recipe below serves 2-3 people, takes 20 mins to prepare and 45 mins to cook.

### Ingredients

- 100ml coconut milk
- 100g sugar
- 1 pinch salt
- 1/4 tsp pandan extract
- 3 eggs
- 120g tapioca starch
- 1 1/4 tsp baking powder
- Vanilla extract

### Instructions

1. Grease only the bottom of your baking pan and put it in the oven with temperature setting of 175C
2. In a small saucepan under low heat, dissolve the salt and sugar with coconut milk.
3. Crack the eggs in a mixing bowl and use a whisk to stir the eggs. Itâ€™s important that you do not beat or whisk the eggs. Simply stir the eggs with the tip of the whisk touching the bottom of the bowl. Avoid creating foam.
4. Add the coconut mixture to the egg mixture and give it a few stirs. Sift the starch and baking powder into the mixture and stir gently in one direction until smooth. Again, avoid creating foam. Add pandan juice/extract and vanilla.
5. Remove the baking pan from the oven and strain the batter directly into the hot baking pan.
6. Place the baking pan right in the middle of the over and bake at 175C for 45min or until the top is golden brown. Insert a skewer into the center of the cake to test for doneness. If the toothpick comes out clean, the cake is done.
7. Cool the cake in its pan, upside down on a cooling rack. When cooled, use a palette knife to loosen and release the cake from the sides.

This cake is best enjoyed fresh. It can keep for 2 days. Bon appetit!
