From the internet to the airplane, there are many great American inventions that changed the world, but one of them is more important than all others: The Sandwich. Whether it’s a BLT or a grilled cheese, there’s no sandwich that wouldn’t improve with a better bread. Here’s a recipe to honour the under appreciated star of the show.

Most sandwich breads use commercial yeast for speed and fluffiness, whereas this recipe elevates it to the next level with the sourdough starter. The olive oil helps the bread stay fresh longer, and the honey balances the sourness & saltiness.

The recipe below takes about 4-6 hours and produces a standard (human) sized loaf.

ingredients:

- 240g all purpose flour
- 120g bread flour
- 72g [sourdough starter](__GHOST_URL__/sourdough-starter-guide/)
- 152g water
- 76g milk
- 21g olive oil
- 7g honey
- 7g salt

instructions:

- Mix all ingredients and knead until smooth, about 8 minutes

2. Stretch and fold 4 times every 30 minutes, for about 2 hours total
3. Shape the dough into a log and transfer to an oiled [Pullman Loaf Pan](https://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-AMB-9LP-Classic-Nonstick-Bakeware/dp/B0000ULZY0)
4. Proof for 1-2 hours, until dough expands into a dome shape
5. Preheat oven to 210c, brush a mixture of egg yolk and a splash of milk on top of the dough
6. Bake for 30 minutes, reduce to 200c and bake another 10 minutes until golden brown
7. Cool on a wire rack and slice.
