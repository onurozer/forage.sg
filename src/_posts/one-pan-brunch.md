The ideal time for this is a Sunday morning, although technically any day would work. The beauty of the recipe is that as far as ingredients are concerned, pretty much anything goes.

## Tips & Tricks

- The pan is your playground. Swap bacon for sausages, mushrooms with onions, whatever rocks your boat (or whatever is left in the fridge).
- Watch for timings. Mushrooms and onions took longer to cook than eggs and tomatoes.
- Adding a bit of butter before cooking eggs is not necessary but highly recommended.
