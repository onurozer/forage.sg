The first time I got introduced to the Negroni was many years ago in an oyster bar in New York, when the guy next to me ordered this mysterious concoction in the early afternoon. Turns out he knew what he was doing: Negroni is one of those cocktails that go perfectly any time of the day. Luckily itâ€™s easy to make and infinitely modifiable.

## Ingredients

- 1 oz. Gin
- 1 oz. Campari
- 1 oz. Sweet Vermouth
- Orange Peel

## Instructions

1. Stir Gin, Campari and Vermouth in a mixing glass over ice
2. Serve on a chilled rocks glass over a single, big ice cube or sphere
3. Garnish with orange peel and serve

## Playing Around

- Beauty of this recipe is endless possibilities. Experiment with [Gran Classico](https://www.tempusfugitspirits.com/gran-classico-bitter) instead of Campari, or [Punt e Mes](http://www.appuntamentoyes.com/) instead of vermouth, prepare for your mind to be blown.
- Swap the gin for mezcal for a smokier version, with bourbon for a digestif instead of an aperitif, or simply with sparkling wine for Negroni Sbagliato.
- Sous-vide the drinks in the recipe together with a handful of green olives for 24 hours at 50c for olive infused Negroni and serious bragging rights, courtesy of [Bar Termini](http://bar-termini-soho.com/).
- Sparkling Negroni anyone? Carbonate it in a [whipping siphon](https://www.isi.com/en/culinary/products/detail/product/gourmet-whip/) with CO2 cartridges and serve chilled.
