Here’s another crowd pleaser for the lazy and the practical. This is the one grilled chicken recipe you’ll ever need. The key to success with this dish is a super hot cast-iron pan and lots of olive oil.

The recipe is for 2 people and takes about 45-60 minutes.

## Ingredients

### For the spice mix:

- 2 tsp paprika
- 2 tsp garlic powder
- 2 tsp dried oregano or rosemary
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp pepper

### For the rest:

- 2 carrots, cut into chunks
- 1 fennel, small, sliced
- 2 chicken legs
- 3 tbsp olive oil, extra-virgin

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 200c together with the cast-iron pan.
2. Gently massage the chicken with the spice mix, let it rest anywhere from 30 mins to 1 day depending on how much time you have.
3. In another bowl, mix all vegetables with a bit of olive oil, salt and pepper
4. Place your chicken in the middle of the pan, skin side down and vegetables on the side. Drizzle generously with the rest of the olive oil.
5. Cook about 30-45 minutes, until the chicken is crispy yet juicy, and the vegetables are cooked yet tender.

## Tips & Tricks

- You can use this recipe with any chicken part or the entire chicken, in which case make sure to rest the chicken a bit longer after the dry rub and use a bit more olive oil.
- Feel free to experiment with spices. Curry powder and crushed coriander seeds give a bit more asian flavour. Sichuan peppers and cayenne give it a nice little kick.
- Raclette potatoes work exceptionally well with this dish. Quarter them for a chunky bite or use a mandoline slicer for that homemade potato chip vibe.
- Leftover (if any) chicken makes a superb sandwich the next day. Serve in it a sandwich bread with Japanese mayo, sliced San Marzano tomatoes and a bit of lettuce. Heaven.
