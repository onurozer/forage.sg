Why is this sometimes called a cake and at other times called a bread? No one really knows but more importantly, the name is not important! All you need to know is that this baked oldie is a goodie that’s great as a breakfast, tea-time break or a post-meal indulgence.

The best part about this cake is its oh-so easy recipe with simply a whisk. The most difficult part? Waiting for those bananas to blacken for an even more aromatic bake!

## Ingredients

- 160g all-purpose flour
- 200g brown sugar
- 3/4 tsp baking powder
- 3/4 tsp baking soda
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1 large egg
- 2 large very ripe bananas, mashed
- 120ml warm water
- 60ml whole milk
- 60ml canola oil or any other light oil
- 3/4 tsp vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 180°C and place rack in the centre of the oven
2. Brush the insides of a baking loaf tin with canola oil and set aside
3. In a large mixing bowl, dry whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt.
4. In another large mixing bowl, whisk the eggs, mashed bananas, water, milk, oil and vanilla extract – in no particular order.
5. Now add the wet ingredients to the bowl of dry ingredients and whisk until all combined. The batter is quite thin here, don’t worry.
6. Pour the batter into the oil-brushed loaf tin and bake for 40-45mins.
7. Insert a skewer or bamboo stick into the centre of the cake to check for doneness. If the stick comes out still with wet batter, continue baking for another 5-10mins.
8. If the skewer comes out clean, remove the loaf tin from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack.
9. Once cooled, release the banana cake from the tin.

You can enjoy the cake warm with a cup of coffee or keep it in the fridge for a couple of days.
