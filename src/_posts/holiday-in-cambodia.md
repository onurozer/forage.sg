This tropical cocktail was invented in Singapore a few years ago during a cocktail workshop with a master bartender –me– and my workshop partner [Riku](https://www.instagram.com/rvassinen/). The name comes from the fact that Riku's wife was on a holiday in Cambodia, while we were working hard mixing cocktails and tomahawk steaks. Tough life.

The original recipe used [Paper Lantern Gin](https://drinkpaperlantern.com), the self-proclaimed Singapore’s first craft gin, ironically made with ingredients from Vietnam and coincidentally by a Turkish founder. That said, any craft peppery gin will work equally well, or maybe even better.

This recipe requires lemongrass syrup, a key ingredient that gives the cocktail it’s tropical flavour and aroma. To make it, combine equal parts of white sugar and water with 3-4 thinly sliced lemongrass stalks. Heat it until it starts to simmer, turn off the heat and steep for 15 minutes and strain through a cheesecloth. It will stay fresh in the fridge for a couple of weeks.

## Tips & Tricks

- Use the freshest eggs you can find, unless you enjoy mild food poisoning.
- Shaking all the ingredients without ice is called a “dry shake” and helps get rid of the egg-y smell. Angostura bitters also serves the same purpose.
- The harder you shake, the smoother your foam will become.
- Strange trivia: angostura bitters had [super sexist weird ads](https://punchdrink.com/articles/seriously-whats-up-with-angostura-bitters-vintage-midcentury-ads/) in the 50’s.
