Nothing makes fresh tomatoes sing like a bruschetta! Even better, for a symphonic Italian opera to your taste buds, just pair it with hand-shredded sweet basil leaves, punchy garlic and a sourdough slice hot out of the oven. Drizzle some extra virgin olive oil and a sprinkle of sea salt and youâ€™ll be hearing Pavarotti in your kitchen!
