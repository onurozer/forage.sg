When it comes to jam, nothing comes close to "kaya" in my heart. Or more accurately in my belly. Kaya jam is made with coconut cream, eggs and sugar. You can the flavour it either with [pandan leaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandanus_amaryllifolius) which gives kaya its signature green hues or you can use palm sugar for a more caramel-like profile.

Wildly popular in Asia, you’ll find kaya in all conceivable forms, from our national heritage kaya toast to mainstream coffee and inventive cocktails. To make kaya the traditional way, you need bain-maire level patience and a whole lot of daydreaming accompanied by auto-pilot circular hand motion!

If that sounds like your kind of jam, then you’ll surely love this recipe.

Kaya jam goes on practically anything you can dream of, but for a true “comfort food” experience, spread it on a <%= link_to "toasted bread", "\_posts/sourdough-sandwich-bread.md" %> with a slab of butter on top for breakfast! The kaya jam should last 1-2 weeks in the fridge.
