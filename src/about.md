Hi! Weâ€™re a Singaporean-Turkish couple living in Switzerland and spending an exorbitant amount of time in the kitchem. Forage is where we share our culinary experiments.

[Audrey](https://www.instagram.com/audrey.chong/) is a food scientist with love for food, animals and nature, in that order.

[Onur](https://twitter.com/onurozer/) is a marketer who enjoys mixing cocktails, baking sourdough, natural wine, aviation, strategy games and yoga, in no particular order.
